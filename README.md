# Fioretti App
A mobile app created for my old high school as my final project for my IT class. Using this app, users can buy tickets for school events. The app features stripe integration, a QR code ticketing system (admins can scan QR code tickets and mark them as used) and an admin panel to create new events and manage tickets. Users can log in with their school account using Google OAuth2
